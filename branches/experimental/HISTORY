Minor bug fix
Fixed some bugs in the interpretation of SBO as SBGN:
association, dissociation, perturbing agent, and non SBGN SBO terms

Major bug fix! Brief summary below... (some minor bug fixes are omitted)
- Application won't freeze anymore upon edge routing, display progress bar with option to cancel
- Added undo function
- various SBO bugs solved:
	* ask for SBO XML file when not found
	* display modifiers in SBGN thanks to proper SBO terms
	* visual representation of modifiers fixed
- Fixed bugs where reactions (and source or sink) were not being allocated to the right compartment
container
- Fixed bug preventing to reopen SBML L2v1 files after saving annotations
- Fixed 2 bugs in arcadia layout format:
	* source and sink that can be saved but not loaded
	* support for multigraph model (e.g. where a species is both product and modifier of a reaction)
- Fixed a number of bugs, to ensure inherent constraints on branch and triangle containers are still
respected upon cloning/uncloning
- More efficient cloning/uncloning when spanning different compartments
- When errors are encountered upon trying to load a file, a dialog box with an error message is
launched (instead of crashing the application with an uncaught runtime exception)

22/10/09
Updated to LibSBML4 in order to read SBML L2v4 files

16/10/09
Fixed layout bugs for triangle configuration and compartments

26/08/09
Fixed typo in graphwindow.cpp that caused an error when compiling on Linux

31/07/09
Corrected a few problems that appeared when testing the interoperability with COPASI
via the layout extension (still not fully resolved)

22/06/09
- Corrected bug in finish install osx = wrong directory
- Implemented filled-in SBGN clone markers
- Corrected a discrepancy between control points and source/target in connector when changing
connection point (resulted in loaded layout edges pointing at wrong connection point)
