<BLOCKQUOTE>Programs often sample behaviour and interpolate between these
samples in order to reduce the amount of information that needs to be stored.
An animation system, for example, may just define object positions in key
frames. By smoothly moving between these key positions, a reasonable frame-rate
may be obtained, even though information is only stored for a couple of
frames.</BLOCKQUOTE>

What Are Twines?</H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Simply following a straight line between successive positions
in an interpolated sequence would result in undesirable behaviour. Sharp
changes of direction would occur at control points as the line representing
the change in value starts moving towards the next control point. A slightly
more complex algorithm is therefore required that takes into account not
only the position of the next control point, but also the one after that.
In this way the interpolated values can be calculated such that they follow
a curve, smoothly passing through control points with no abrupt changes
in direction.

<P>There is a myriad of algorithms for generating curves. These are usually
based on systems of control points, such as NURBS for example. Most algorithms
however are more complex than required for interpolation. Often they are
three or four-dimensional and involve either weights at control points
or extra control points to influence the shape of the curve. Many are also
not efficient to implement, especially at having their control points updated.
For the purposes of interpolation, the aim is to estimate the shape in
between control points, not describe it. A much simpler algorithm would
therefore not only be sufficient, but desirable.

<P>Twines are my implementation of two-dimensional curves. They relate
one value to another using control points to define the shape of the curve.
Some of the benefits of using twines are:
<UL>
<LI>
Twines are intended for rapid real-time use. They are very efficient at
being both modified and evaluated. Control points are stored in efficient
balanced trees and the shape of the curve is implicit from this.</LI>

<LI>
The curve is guaranteed pass through all the control points smoothly.</LI>

<LI>
The curve will never loop or have other strange effects. There will always
be one y value for any x value.</LI>

<LI>
Sections of curves between control points are only influenced by the closest
four control points, so updates further along the curve will not cause
unwanted side-effects.</LI>

<LI>
Easy to use as they are implemented in a shared DLL.</LI>

<LI>
They have a good name :-)</LI>

<A NAME="Twine Types"></A>Twine Types</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There are a number of different types of Twine. The type defines
their behaviour outside of the range defined by the control points.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="limited.gif" HEIGHT=123 WIDTH=224 ALIGN=RIGHT>Limited Range</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Twine is constrained to the range defined by the control
points with the maximum and minimum interval values. If an attempt is made
to evaluate the Twine outside of this range, an error will be returned.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="repeating.gif" HEIGHT=123 WIDTH=224 ALIGN=RIGHT>Repeating</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Twine repeats forever. The same defined shape of the Twine
repeats at each end of the defined range. Bear in mind that the shape of
the Twine therefore at each end will be influenced by the position of control
points at the opposite end. This is to ensure the Twine repeats smoothly.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="smooth.gif" HEIGHT=124 WIDTH=225 ALIGN=RIGHT>Smooth Continuous</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Twine repeats forever. The Twine continues along the same
curve as that connecting the end control points and their neighbours.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="linear.gif" HEIGHT=124 WIDTH=225 ALIGN=RIGHT>Linear Continuous</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Twine repeats forever. The Twine continues with the same
gradient as that at end control points.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
<IMG SRC="constant.gif" HEIGHT=124 WIDTH=225 ALIGN=RIGHT>Constant Continuous</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Twine repeats forever. The Twine continues with the same
value as that at the end control points.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
