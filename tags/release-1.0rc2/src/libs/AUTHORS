For fairness sake, a short historical overview of the authorship of the libraries in this directory:

Alice Villeger wrote the current Makefile for the libavoid and twine libraries, to be used by the arcadia1.0 application
That Makefile was largely inspired from libavoid and twines original respective Makefile instructions,
but was adapted to allow for windows compilation, not just mac/unix compilation

None of the two libraries themselves were written by Alice Villeger

The actual libavoid source code ((C) 2004-2006 Michael Wybrow) has not been modified at all
(it's an old alpha version from 2006, so there is most probably a newer one on the author's webpage)

The twine source code ((C) 1997-1998 James Marsh) has been mildly modified by Alice Villeger:
- downloaded the latest version of rb.h and rb.c ((C) 2000 James S. Plank) and used them as is
- patched twine.c as the name of an rb function had changed
- added missing copyright information to the twine code, after asking for James Marsh's permission to publish it as LGPL
