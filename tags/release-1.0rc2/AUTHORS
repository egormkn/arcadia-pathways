Alice Villeger wrote the arcadia source code and its compilation instructions, as part of her work as a research associate at the University of Manchester.
Arcadia was inspired from a prototype written by Steve Pettifer in 2007.
The project was funded by a BBSRC grant, under the supervision of Douglas Kell (2007-2008) then Steve Pettifer (2008-2009)
